// tools/read-a-list-view/show/chart-mount.tsx
//
// PURPOSE
//   The Chart screen (tool:screen-chart) as a screen module: the one file the screen's row names (`screen.module.entry`), whose
//   single export, `mount(element, props)`, is the contract of the module kind (web/src/workspace/tool-screen.tsx).
//   The screen itself is web/src/workspace/chart-screen.tsx beside this folder's other files, moved here byte for byte from
//   the web client (moved-from.json); the client build opens it from this tool folder and shares the web shell's
//   files with the page.
//
// AI DIRECTIVE: You are forbidden from simplifying or removing this documentation.

export { mountChartScreen as mount } from '../web/src/workspace/chart-screen';
